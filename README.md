### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an Image Scientist working for the US DoD. I recently completed my Master's of Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I concentrated in deep reinforcement learning, visual control, and machine learning, primarily for continuous control tasks and autonomous driving. **[My thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/138972)** was co-advised by Professor Daniela Rus and Professor Sertac Karaman in MIT's CSAIL Distributed Robotics Laboratory.

Outside of research, I had the chance to work as a teaching assistant for MIT's 6.801/6.866: Machine Vision course under Professor Berthold K.P. Horn (Fall 2020), as well as pursue graduate coursework in reinforcement learning, computer vision for autonomous vehicles, and probabilistic programming. In addition to learning more about machine learning, robotics, and remote sensing, I am really interested in learning how to be the most effective teacher and mentor possible.

I look forward to working with you to advance the open-source community!
