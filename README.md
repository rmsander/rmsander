### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Lidar Image Scientist working for the US Government. I recently completed my Master's of Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I concentrated in deep reinforcement learning, visual control, and machine learning, primarily for continuous control tasks and autonomous driving. My thesis was co-advised by Professor Daniela Rus and Professor Sertac Karaman in MIT's CSAIL Distributed Robotics Laboratory.

Outside of research, I have had the chance to work as a teaching assistant for MIT's 6.801/6.866: Machine Vision course under Professor Berthold K.P. Horn (Fall 2020), as well as pursue graduate coursework in reinforcement learning, computer vision for autonomous vehicles, and probabilistic programming. I am really interested in learning how to be the most effective teacher possible.

I look forward to working with you to advance the open-source community!
